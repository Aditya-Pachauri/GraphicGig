## **Procedure:**

2. Decide the Font/ Type-face you would be using according to the context of the text. You can do font-pairing i.e., use different font for Headings/ Sub-headings but, don't loose the **Consistency**.
3. Check for margins and spacings. The proper use of white space ensures an excellent user experience and a great readability experience. It helps to balance design elements and better organize content to improve the visual communication experience.
4. For Submission you would have to submit the link to the doc file or Figma file in a .txt file into the **"Understanding Typography"** folder only.
